# The **µnix** Operating System

"µnix", "munix" or, "micro unix" aims to be a micro kernel based operating system targeting the Raspberry Pi Pico.

"µnix" is an execise in minimalism to see if micro kernels are viable on such constrained systems.

We want "µnix" to feel like any regular unix-like operating system.
